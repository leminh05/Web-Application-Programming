        <h1>Over 10,000 downloads of ’Super Thief’ game in 2016</h1>
        <p>
            Unlike traditional claw machine games that operate offline or
            at game centers, the "Super Thief" game is the first in
            Vietnam to allow users to interact with a physical claw
            machine device, using an Internet connection to control the
            machine and receive images from a camera. With this
            application, players become thieves, using a drone with a claw
            to pick up gift boxes and drop them into a tunnel. When
            successful, players receive a result notification, and rewards
            can be redeemed directly as phone cards. The unique feature
            of the game is the need to "wait" for your turn, as the
            machine allows only one player at a time.
